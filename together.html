                        Ghosts V: Together (also known as Halo 33) is the second installment of Ghosts from Nine Inch Nails. It was both announced and digitally released on March 26, 2020, during the #STAYHOME initiative in the wake of COVID-19 isolation due to viral outbreak worldwide.

                        It was released alongside Ghosts' third installment, Ghosts VI: Locusts, making them the only NIN releases to date to be put out simultaneously. They are also the only proper NIN releases to be digital only. The music is highly reminiscent of score work by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and bears little resemblance to the first installment of Ghosts.                </div>

                    In 2019, after releasing their eighth soundtrack to the film Bird Box, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross completed a subsequent score for The Woman in the Window; however, when the production studio decided to re-edit the film after test screenings, Reznor and Ross' score was withdrawn. When evoking the project, Reznor admitted, “It’s frustrating when you did that much work and it’s gone. And we were proud—and they were proud—of the movie that it was.”

                    In March 2020, following two subsequent 2019 soundtracks Watchmen and Waves, Reznor announced two unexpected releases, Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts, for free download through the official Nine Inch Nails website, YouTube channel, and streaming platforms: "Hours and hours of music. Free. Some of it kind of happy, some not so much." The band's website added, "As the news seems to turn ever more grim by the hour, we've found ourselves vacillating wildly between feeling like there may be hope at times to utter despair—often changing minute to minute. Although each of us define ourselves as antisocial-types who prefer being on our own, this situation has really made us appreciate the power and need for CONNECTION."                </p>
