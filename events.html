                        Not The Actual Events (also known as Halo 29) is the second proper EP from Nine Inch Nails. It was released digitally on December 23, 2016, though pre-orders through nin.com allowed for a download one day early. This EP acts as the first installment of a trilogy, preceding the 2017 release of Add Violence and the 2018 release of Bad Witch. This is the first release to include Atticus Ross as an official member of NIN.

                    In an interview promoting Apple Music, Trent Reznor mentioned he has started "messing around with some things" in regard to a new Nine Inch Nails album, stating, "It's not a record I'm trying to finish in a month. It's more just feeling around in the dark and seeing what sounds interesting." In December 2015, Reznor reported that "Nine Inch Nails will return in 2016". He and Atticus Ross later scored the soundtracks for Before the Flood and Patriots Day in 2016.

                    In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails' return by the end of the year: "Those words did come out of my mouth, didn't they? [...] Just wait and see what happens." Three days later, Reznor announced Not the Actual Events, along with reissues of Nine Inch Nails' previous releases.

                    The EP marks a return to Nine Inch Nails' 1990s sound, departing from the texture and groove-oriented style of the previous album, Hesitation Marks. Nevertheless, it also preserves electronic elements of the Hesitation Marks and Year Zero, but features "more organic elements" such as "noisy guitars, nostalgic piano lines and heavily distorted bass used on The Fragile and With Teeth." Reznor described the record as "an unfriendly, fairly impenetrable record that we needed to make." The sound of the EP has also been labeled as industrial metal.
